## WTF is this?

YOLO is not intended for production use. It was created for the "Silex
Anatomy" talk to demonstrate more clearly the distinct responsibilities of
different parts of the `Silex\Application` class. Think of it as an academic
version of silex that can be cut up for inspection, fun and experimentation.

Watch the video recording of the talk:

* [PHPBenelux 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VUoIruQNMg)
* [Symfony Live London 2012](https://vimeo.com/51201498)

From a later version of the talk there are also
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/igorw/silex-anatomy-phpne).

You will probably want to continue using
[silex](https://github.com/fabpot/Silex) for your work.

## How is this different from silex?

* More pure, less usable.
* symfony/dependency-injection instead of pimple
* more animated gif

## What does YOLO mean?

## Swag?

> The most used word in the whole fucking universe. Douche bags use it, your
> kids use it, your mail man uses it, and your fucking dog uses it. If you got
> swag, you generally wear those shitty hats side way, and your ass hanging
> out like a fucking goof cause your pants are half way down your white ass
> legs.

> *-- Urban Dictionary*

## But I want to use it in production

Feel free to use it. If it fits your needs, that is perfectly fine.

## Will you change the name?

No, never.
