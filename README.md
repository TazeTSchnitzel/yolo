## What does YOLO mean?

* [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yolo)

## Swag?

> The most used word in the whole fucking universe. Douche bags use it, your
> kids use it, your mail man uses it, and your fucking dog uses it. If you got
> swag, you generally wear those shitty hats side way, and your ass hanging
> out like a fucking goof cause your pants are half way down your white ass
> legs.
