# YOLO

The microframework with swag.

## WTF is this?

YOLO is not intended for production use. It was created for the "Silex
Anatomy" talk to demonstrate more clearly the distinct responsibilities of
different parts of the `Silex\Application` class. Think of it as an academic
version of silex that can be cut up for inspection, fun and experimentation.

You will probably want to continue using
[silex](https://github.com/fabpot/Silex) for your work.

## But I want to use it in production

Feel free to use it. If it fits your needs, that is perfectly fine.

## Will you change the name?

No, never.
